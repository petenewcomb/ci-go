# Development Guide

This document provides guidance for anyone (human or AI) working on Go codebases using the ci-go template.

## Reference Materials
- See `README.md` for project overview, `docs` folder for design documentation, `benchmarks` for previous investigations
- Check `TODO.md` for branch-specific work requirements and pre-merge checklists
- Review `WORKING_NOTES.md` for current development context and insights on active branches
- Review GitHub issues for project-wide planning and cross-branch work streams

## Concurrency Safety
- Think deeply and systematically about concurrency issues, especially regarding potential orders of operations
- Consider what happens when operations occur in unexpected sequences
- Use atomic operations when possible in hot paths, but ensure proper synchronization everywhere
- Pay special attention to lifecycle management during shutdown phases - ensure all components complete their work properly
- Ensure proper resource cleanup and avoid resource leaks during shutdown 

## Build/Test/Source Control Commands

### Code Quality & Validation
- Use `goimports` to fix up imports
- Use `go vet ./...` to verify code correctness instead of running a build with `go build` unless you really need the executable(s)
- Use `.githooks/pre-commit` to run pre-commit checks before attempting a commit; pay attention to its return code and realize that it may make modifications that mean files must be (re-)staged.

### Testing
- Run all tests in short mode for general functional validation: `go test -short ./...` as tests may take several minutes to run without `-short`
- Use `go test -run '^TestOrExampleName$' ./...` with or without `-short` to run a specific test or example
- Use `go test -coverprofile coverage.out -coverpkg ./...` with or without `-short` to calculate test coverage
- Use `go test -race` to engage the race detector, which will slow execution time but detect at least egregious cross-thread data access problems.
- Remember that `go test` will usually output nothing upon success. To force it to generate output for all tests run use `-v`. Also pay attention to the exit code.

### Benchmarking
- When running benchmarks, always set bash timeout greater than the expected duration to account for overhead (including warmup)

### Git & Source Control
- Avoid adding unrelated untracked files to a commit.  Prefer `git add -u` over `git add .`, or better yet just stage files by naming them explicitly.
- Always verify git commit success by checking the command output. Pre-commit hooks can fail silently or make formatting changes that prevent the commit. Look for error output, and if the pre-commit hook runs `git status --porcelain -uno | grep '^[^ ][^ ]'` and finds modified files, the commit failed. You must stage any hook-generated changes and retry the commit.

## Code Style

### Process & Tooling
- See .githooks/pre-commit for expectations of code ready to review
- See .github/workflows/ci.yml and its dependencies for full build and test expectations
- See .github/workflows/release.yml and its dependencies for release expectations
- Update CHANGELOG.md according to the instructions and references in its preamble

### Code Quality & Go Best Practices
- Expect and produce idiomatic Go code and documentation
- Diverge from well-known Go best practices only after thinking hard about alternatives and documenting your reasoning
- Handle errors explicitly - don't ignore them
- Use the context package properly, especially to enable cancellation where appropriate

### Formatting & File Organization
- Ensure that all files include the same copyright header
- Ensure that each text file ends in a newline unless it's important that it does not  
- Organize the contents of files so that they read whole-to-part, top-to-bottom, as a narrative story insofar as possible

### Naming & Documentation
- Choose names that ensure that code is as self-documenting as possible
- Field and method naming should clearly indicate purpose
- Use meaningful types for enum-like constants
- Document exported types and functions
- Document non-exported types and functions if there are non-evident details the reader should know
- Add explanatory and/or narrative comments to code when there are non-evident details the reader should keep in mind
- Do not add comments that effectively repeat what the code itself already says effectively

### Design & Safety
- Focus not only on achieving intended functionality and behavior but also on making non-intended functionality and behavior impossible
- Validate user inputs explicitly if invalid inputs could cause delayed or difficult-to-understand errors, outputs, or behaviors
- Buffer channels when waiting for signals that might be sent before receivers are ready

### Testing Standards
- Use `require` package for test assertions, usually by instantiating a `chk` variable with `require.New` 

## Documentation Style
- Design documents should be mostly prose but still include key diagrams, small code blocks, and structured lists where they help with clarity or pedagogy.
- Make sure that any tunable parameters are referred to as such and avoid implying that any concrete values provided as examples are dictated by the design.
- Always include discussion of rejected alternatives.

## Testing Guidelines
1. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
2. Ensure deterministic behavior in tests
3. Test for concurrency issues and race conditions when applicable
4. Verify cancellation and cleanup work properly
5. Use property-based testing tools for robust validation
6. When testing performance changes, use consistent benchmark environments and compare normalized results
7. Test resource cleanup and proper shutdown behavior
