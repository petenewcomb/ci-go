# CI-Go Working Notes

## Repository Overview
Common CI resources for Go projects - a template repository providing comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows and pre-commit hooks for Go development.

## Current State Analysis

### GitHub Actions Workflows
**Structure**: Well-designed modular approach with main `ci.yml` orchestrating separate workflows:
- `build.yml`: Multi-version Go builds with compilation validation
- `test.yml`: Comprehensive testing (short/full, race detection, benchmarks, coverage)
- `lint.yml`: Code quality (gofmt, goimports, go vet, golangci-lint)
- `vuln.yml`: Security scanning with govulncheck
- `release.yml`: Automated releases from CHANGELOG.md (syntax error fixed)

**Security posture**: Excellent - minimal permissions, explicit declarations, proper concurrency control

### Pre-commit Hook
Located in `.githooks/pre-commit` - comprehensive script covering:
- Multi-module support with `go.mod` detection
- Full toolchain: tidy, vet, imports, fmt, lint, test, generate
- Git status validation to prevent dirty commits

## Improvement Opportunities

### GitHub Actions
1. **Performance**: Add Go module caching to speed up builds
2. **Security**: Pin action versions to SHA hashes for supply chain security
3. **Compatibility**: Add Windows/macOS to test matrix
4. **Compliance**: Consider SBOM generation for security requirements

### Pre-commit Hook
1. **Performance**: Parallelize tool execution where possible
2. **Efficiency**: Use selective execution based on changed files
3. **UX**: Improve error reporting and tool availability checks

## Architecture Notes
- Reusable workflow design allows customization via inputs
- Coverage reporting integrated with GitHub wiki
- Release automation tied to CHANGELOG.md format
- Multi-Go-version testing ensures compatibility

## Usage Analysis: psg-go Integration

### Current Implementation
**psg-go** demonstrates clean consumption of ci-go workflows:
- **CI workflow**: References `petenewcomb/ci-go/.github/workflows/ci.yml@v0.0.8`
- **Release workflow**: References `petenewcomb/ci-go/.github/workflows/release.yml@v0.0.8`
- **Customization**: Extended test timeouts (30min job, 25min go test) for performance-intensive workloads

### Integration Assessment
**Strengths**:
- Clean separation of concerns - consuming project only defines triggers and customizations
- Pinned to specific version (v0.0.8) for stability
- Appropriate timeout extensions for benchmark-heavy project
- Minimal duplication - 2 simple workflow files vs 6 complex ones

**Observations**:
- psg-go is a performance-focused library with extensive benchmarking infrastructure
- Extended timeouts suggest computationally intensive tests/benchmarks
- Project successfully leverages ci-go template without modification

### Template Effectiveness
The psg-go usage validates ci-go's design:
- **Modularity**: Workflows are properly reusable across projects
- **Configurability**: Input parameters allow necessary customizations
- **Maintainability**: Updates to ci-go automatically benefit consuming projects
- **Version control**: Semantic versioning allows controlled updates

## Next Steps Considerations
- Template is production-ready as-is for most Go projects
- Performance optimizations would be valuable for larger codebases
- Security enhancements align with enterprise requirements
- Consider adding more input parameters based on real-world usage patterns
