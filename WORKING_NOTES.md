# CI-Go Working Notes

## Repository Overview
Common CI resources for Go projects - a template repository providing comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows and pre-commit hooks for Go development.

## Current State Analysis

### GitHub Actions Workflows
**Structure**: Well-designed modular approach with main `ci.yml` orchestrating separate workflows:
- `build.yml`: Multi-version Go builds with compilation validation
- `test.yml`: Comprehensive testing (short/full, race detection, benchmarks, coverage)
- `lint.yml`: Code quality (gofmt, goimports, go vet, golangci-lint)
- `vuln.yml`: Security scanning with govulncheck
- `release.yml`: Automated releases from CHANGELOG.md (syntax error fixed)

**Security posture**: Excellent - minimal permissions, explicit declarations, proper concurrency control

### Pre-commit Hook
Located in `.githooks/pre-commit` - comprehensive script covering:
- Multi-module support with `go.mod` detection
- Full toolchain: tidy, vet, imports, fmt, lint, test, generate
- Git status validation to prevent dirty commits

## Improvement Opportunities

### GitHub Actions
1. **Performance**: Add Go module caching to speed up builds
2. **Security**: Pin action versions to SHA hashes for supply chain security
3. **Compatibility**: Add Windows/macOS to test matrix
4. **Compliance**: Consider SBOM generation for security requirements

### Pre-commit Hook
1. **Performance**: Parallelize tool execution where possible
2. **Efficiency**: Use selective execution based on changed files
3. **UX**: Improve error reporting and tool availability checks

## Architecture Notes
- Reusable workflow design allows customization via inputs
- Coverage reporting integrated with GitHub wiki
- Release automation tied to CHANGELOG.md format
- Multi-Go-version testing ensures compatibility

## Usage Analysis: psg-go Integration

### Current Implementation
**psg-go** demonstrates clean consumption of ci-go workflows:
- **CI workflow**: References `petenewcomb/ci-go/.github/workflows/ci.yml@v0.0.8`
- **Release workflow**: References `petenewcomb/ci-go/.github/workflows/release.yml@v0.0.8`
- **Customization**: Extended test timeouts (30min job, 25min go test) for performance-intensive workloads

### Integration Assessment
**Strengths**:
- Clean separation of concerns - consuming project only defines triggers and customizations
- Pinned to specific version (v0.0.8) for stability
- Appropriate timeout extensions for benchmark-heavy project
- Minimal duplication - 2 simple workflow files vs 6 complex ones

**Observations**:
- psg-go is a performance-focused library with extensive benchmarking infrastructure
- Extended timeouts suggest computationally intensive tests/benchmarks
- Project successfully leverages ci-go template without modification

### Template Effectiveness
The psg-go usage validates ci-go's design:
- **Modularity**: Workflows are properly reusable across projects
- **Configurability**: Input parameters allow necessary customizations
- **Maintainability**: Updates to ci-go automatically benefit consuming projects
- **Version control**: Semantic versioning allows controlled updates

## Multi-Module Support Implementation

### Architecture
**Reusable Component**: Created `modules.yml` workflow that discovers all Go modules using same logic as pre-commit hook:
- Uses `find . -type f -name go.mod` for consistent module discovery
- Outputs JSON array of module directories for matrix execution
- Handles path normalization (./path → path, . → .)

**Matrix Strategy**: All workflows (build, lint, test, vuln) now use:
- Module discovery job followed by matrix execution job
- `working-directory` parameter for each module
- Parallel execution across modules and Go versions

### Validation Results
**psg-go Testing**: Successfully validated with 4-module repository:
- Root module (.) - heavy benchmark suite, ~60min timeout
- internal/cmd/benchnorm - utility module, quick completion
- internal/cmd/chartgen - utility module, quick completion  
- otpsg - library module, quick completion

**Performance**: Matrix execution allows:
- Utility modules complete in ~2-3 minutes
- Heavy benchmark modules get full timeout allowance
- No blocking between modules - truly parallel execution

### Workflow Changes
**Separation of Concerns**: Moved `go generate` from build to lint workflow
- Build focuses on compilation validation
- Lint handles code quality, formatting, and generation currency
- Better logical separation and clearer failure attribution

## Performance Optimization Assessment

### Go Module Caching Analysis
**Discovery**: `actions/setup-go@v5` includes built-in module caching by default
- No manual caching configuration needed
- Automatic cache key management based on `go.sum` files
- Optimized for multi-module repositories
- Cross-platform and cross-version compatible

**Decision**: Leverage built-in caching rather than manual `actions/cache` implementation
- Simpler configuration (no additional steps required)
- Better maintenance (managed by GitHub Actions team)
- Optimal cache strategy (designed specifically for Go workflows)

### Security vs Maintainability Trade-offs
**SHA Pinning Evaluation**: 
- **Security benefit**: Immutable action versions, supply chain protection
- **Maintenance cost**: Manual SHA hash updates for each new release
- **Template context**: ci-go is a reusable template used across projects

**Decision**: Use semantic version tags (`@v4`, `@v5`) instead of SHA pinning
- Better user experience for template consumers
- Automatic security patch updates
- Easier maintenance across consuming repositories
- Version tags provide sufficient security for most use cases

### Current Performance State
**Optimizations in place**:
- Built-in Go module caching via `actions/setup-go@v5`
- Multi-module parallel execution via matrix strategy
- Efficient module discovery with consistent logic

## Advanced Workflow Optimizations

### Parallel Test Execution
**Implementation**: Split test workflow into `test-short` and `test-full` jobs running in parallel
- Short tests: 3 configurations (default, 1-cpu, race) with 5-10 minute timeouts
- Full tests: 3 configurations (coverage, 1-cpu, race) with 10-15 minute timeouts
- Composite action eliminates boilerplate across 18 total test matrix combinations

**Granular Timeout Control**: Per-configuration timeout inputs allow precise resource allocation
- `shortTestTimeoutMinutes`, `short1CpuTestTimeoutMinutes`, etc.
- Job timeouts derived automatically: `matrix.test-config.timeoutMinutes + 5`
- Enables PSG's heavy benchmarks (30+ min) while keeping short tests fast (5 min)

### Enhanced Security and Code Quality
**License Auditing**: `go-licenses` integration prevents restrictive dependencies
- Blocks forbidden, restricted, unknown license types
- Includes test dependencies (`--include_tests`)
- Critical for library projects like PSG that affect consumer licensing

**Comprehensive Linting**: Enhanced golangci-lint configuration adds 15+ additional linters
- Security: `gosec`, `bodyclose`, `errchkjson`, `noctx`, `rowserrcheck`
- Performance: `gocritic`, `prealloc`, `unconvert`, `makezero`
- Code quality: `misspell`, `goconst`, `cyclop`, `dupl`
- Configuration included as template in ci-go for easy adoption

### Workflow Architecture Refinements
**Separation of Concerns**: Repository-wide vs per-module operations
- Repository-wide: formatting (`gofmt`, `goimports`), comprehensive linting
- Per-module: dependency management (`go mod tidy`), generation, vet, license checks
- Matches optimized pre-commit hook pattern for maximum efficiency

**Descriptive Job Naming**: Replaced generic `run:` IDs with semantic names
- Better GitHub Actions UI experience
- Clearer failure attribution and debugging

## Current Implementation Status

### Matrix Timeout System
Successfully implemented granular timeout controls using shell-computed matrix approach.
Test configurations support per-type timeout settings (short: 5-10min, full: 10-15min).
See comments in `.github/workflows/test.yml` calculate-matrix job for technical details.

### Multi-Module Support  
All workflows handle repositories with multiple Go modules using consistent discovery logic.
Matrix execution allows parallel processing across modules and configurations.

### Enhanced Security
Comprehensive golangci-lint configuration with 15+ additional linters.
License auditing prevents restrictive dependencies in consuming projects.

## Next Steps
- Release v0.0.9 with matrix timeout functionality
- Monitor performance across different repository sizes
- Consider additional security scanning integration
